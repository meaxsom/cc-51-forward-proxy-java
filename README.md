# Coding Challenge 51: Forward Proxy

## Background
Challenge #51 is for a [forward proxy](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-51-http-forward). 

This effort will use:
- Java - the OpenJDK Java implmentation
- Gradle - as the build process - using Groovy as the DSL
- git for source control - pushed up to github

## Notes
- Wanted to use a dev container envornment for development but found is slow
