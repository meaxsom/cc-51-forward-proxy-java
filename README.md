# Coding Challenge 51: Forward Proxy

## Background
Challenge #51 is for a [forward proxy](https://codingchallenges.substack.com/p/coding-challenge-51-http-forward). 

This effort will use:
- Java - the AWS Java implmentation
- VS Code using a Java Dev Containers
- Gradle - as the build process - using Groovy as the DSL
- git for source control - pushed up to github

## Notes
- Don't forget to turn off `java.gradle.buildServer.enabled`
- Also had to set "Java > Server > Launch Mode to "Standard"
    - Hybrid didn't seem to complete
